 Returns a set of temporary security credentials (consisting of an access key
 ID, a secret access key, and a security token) for a federated user. A
 typical use is in a proxy application that gets temporary security
 credentials on behalf of distributed applications inside a corporate network.
 You must call the <code>GetFederationToken</code> operation using the
 long-term security credentials of an IAM user. As a result, this call is
 appropriate in contexts where those credentials can be safely stored, usually
 in a server-based application. For a comparison of
 <code>GetFederationToken</code> with the other API operations that produce
 temporary credentials, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_request.html">Requesting Temporary Security Credentials</a> and <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_request.html#stsapi_comparison">Comparing the Amazon Web Services STS API operations</a> in the <i>IAM User
 Guide</i>.
 </p>
 <note>
 <p>
 You can create a mobile-based or browser-based app that can authenticate
 users using a web identity provider like Login with Amazon, Facebook, Google,
 or an OpenID Connect-compatible identity provider. In this case, we recommend
 that you use <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/cognito/">Amazon Cognito</a> or
 <code>AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity</code>. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_request.html#api_assumerolewithwebidentity">Federation Through a Web-based Identity Provider</a> in the <i>IAM User
 Guide</i>.
 </p>
 </note>
 <p>
 You can also call <code>GetFederationToken</code> using the security
 credentials of an Amazon Web Services account root user, but we do not
 recommend it. Instead, we recommend that you create an IAM user for the
 purpose of the proxy application. Then attach a policy to the IAM user that
 limits federated users to only the actions and resources that they need to
 access. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html">IAM Best Practices</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.
 </p>
 <p>
 <b>Session duration</b>
 </p>
 <p>
 The temporary credentials are valid for the specified duration, from 900
 seconds (15 minutes) up to a maximum of 129,600 seconds (36 hours). The
 default session duration is 43,200 seconds (12 hours). Temporary credentials
 obtained by using the Amazon Web Services account root user credentials have
 a maximum duration of 3,600 seconds (1 hour).
 </p>
 <p>
 <b>Permissions</b>
 </p>
 <p>
 You can use the temporary credentials created by
 <code>GetFederationToken</code> in any Amazon Web Services service except the
 following:
 </p>
 <ul>
 <li>
 <p>
 You cannot call any IAM operations using the CLI or the Amazon Web Services
 API.
 </p>
 </li>
 <li>
 <p>
 You cannot call any STS operations except <code>GetCallerIdentity</code>.
 </p>
 </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
 You must pass an inline or managed <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies.html#policies_session">session policy</a> to this operation. You can pass a single JSON policy
 document to use as an inline session policy. You can also specify up to 10
 managed policies to use as managed session policies. The plaintext that you
 use for both inline and managed session policies can't exceed 2,048
 characters.
 </p>
 <p>
 Though the session policy parameters are optional, if you do not pass a
 policy, then the resulting federated user session has no permissions. When
 you pass session policies, the session permissions are the intersection of
 the IAM user policies and the session policies that you pass. This gives you
 a way to further restrict the permissions for a federated user. You cannot
 use session policies to grant more permissions than those that are defined in
 the permissions policy of the IAM user. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies.html#policies_session">Session Policies</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>. For information about
 using <code>GetFederationToken</code> to create temporary security
 credentials, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_request.html#api_getfederationtoken">GetFederationTokenâ€”Federation Through a Custom Identity Broker</a>.
 </p>
 <p>
 You can use the credentials to access a resource that has a resource-based
 policy. If that policy specifically references the federated user session in
 the <code>Principal</code> element of the policy, the session has the
 permissions allowed by the policy. These permissions are granted in addition
 to the permissions granted by the session policies.
 </p>
 <p>
 <b>Tags</b>
 </p>
 <p>
 (Optional) You can pass tag key-value pairs to your session. These are called
 session tags. For more information about session tags, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_session-tags.html">Passing Session Tags in STS</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.
 </p>
 <note>
 <p>
 You can create a mobile-based or browser-based app that can authenticate
 users using a web identity provider like Login with Amazon, Facebook, Google,
 or an OpenID Connect-compatible identity provider. In this case, we recommend
 that you use <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/cognito/">Amazon Cognito</a> or
 <code>AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity</code>. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_request.html#api_assumerolewithwebidentity">Federation Through a Web-based Identity Provider</a> in the <i>IAM User
 Guide</i>.
 </p>
 </note>
 <p>
 An administrator must grant you the permissions necessary to pass session
 tags. The administrator can also create granular permissions to allow you to
 pass only specific session tags. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/tutorial_attribute-based-access-control.html">Tutorial: Using Tags for Attribute-Based Access Control</a> in the <i>IAM
 User Guide</i>.
 </p>
 <p>
 Tag keyâ€“value pairs are not case sensitive, but case is preserved. This means
 that you cannot have separate <code>Department</code> and
 <code>department</code> tag keys. Assume that the user that you are
 federating has the <code>Department</code>=<code>Marketing</code> tag and you
 pass the <code>department</code>=<code>engineering</code> session tag.
 <code>Department</code> and <code>department</code> are not saved as separate
 tags, and the session tag passed in the request takes precedence over the
 user tag.

 You must pass an inline or managed <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies.html#policies_session">session policy</a> to this operation. You can pass a single JSON policy

 </p>
 <p>
 This parameter is optional. However, if you do not pass any session
 policies, then the resulting federated user session has no permissions.
 </p>
 <p>
 When you pass session policies, the session permissions are the
 intersection of the IAM user policies and the session policies that you

 federated user. You cannot use session policies to grant more permissions
 than those that are defined in the permissions policy of the IAM user.
 For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies.html#policies_session">Session Policies</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.

 <p>
 The resulting credentials can be used to access a resource that has a
 resource-based policy. If that policy specifically references the
 federated user session in the <code>Principal</code> element of the
 policy, the session has the permissions allowed by the policy. These
 permissions are granted in addition to the permissions that are granted
 by the session policies.

 <p>
 The plaintext that you use for both inline and managed session policies
 can't exceed 2,048 characters. The JSON policy characters can be any
 ASCII character from the space character to the end of the valid
 character list ( through Ã¿). It can also include the tab ( ),
 linefeed ( ), and carriage return ( ) characters.

 <p>
 An Amazon Web Services conversion compresses the passed session policies
 and session tags into a packed binary format that has a separate limit.
 Your request can fail for this limit even if your plaintext meets the
 other requirements. The <code>PackedPolicySize</code> response element
 indicates by percentage how close the policies and tags for your request
 are to the upper size limit.
